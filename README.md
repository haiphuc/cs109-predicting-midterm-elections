# cs109_predicting_midterm_elections
This served as homework for the [CS109 Data Science cource](http://cs109.org) and was represented as a [Jupyter Notebook](HW4.ipynb).

First: I will read in the polls from the 2014 Senate Midterm Elections from the [HuffPost Pollster API](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api/v2) and create a dictionary of DataFrames as well a master table information for each race.

Second: I will compute a 99% confidence interval for each race.

Third: I will perform a Bayesian analysis to predict the probability of Republicans winning in each race then provide a posterior distribution of the number of republicans in the senate.
